      <h1>Analyzing Conflict</h1>
      <h3>Sources, Emotions, and Teachings from the Past</h3>
      <h4>03/28/2015</h4>

      <p>
      I worked at a place with predominantly men. I didn’t have a problem working with other men, after all, that was what most of my engineering classes looked like. My co-worker spoke to me trying to explain what GitHub was, assuming I didn’t know. I was frustrated and kept in my anger, hoping he’d pause to ask, but he continued explaining as if I knew nothing about it. It didn’t bug me that he explained, that was very nice of him, but he assumed the other guys knew and I didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would trace the source of the conflict back to asking a question about the inter-workings of GitHub. I felt frustrated and slightly annoyed that he would try and simplify something I had already told him I knew how to do. The first time I quickly tried to tell him I already knew what he was trying to explain, but he couldn’t care less and decided to continue speaking his mind. I didn’t feel as respected or understood as just as competent as the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I could go back, I would definitely ask him to take a short break with me and discuss how I felt, and why he felt the need to continue explaining to me and not the others. Quite frankly, It made me feel uncomfortable. Talking to him in private would have been a good idea in order to sort things out one-on-one. I learned a lot from just this one experience. I learned I should hold my ground, and discuss issues that bother me with the inflicter. This would have helped him realize that although his intentions may have been good, the world needs more people with less assumptions on others’ talents and capabilities.
