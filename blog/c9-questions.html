      <h1>Questioning How To Question</h1>
      <h3>Don't Just Ask Questions, Ask Them Well</h3>
      <h4>04/03/2015</h4>

      <p>
        The more questions you ask, the more you'll know; but how you ask your questions will determine the amount of useful information you receive. If you're asking a question with a title of "Please Help" or "Why doesn't this work?!", you're not making it easy for another person to help answer your question. Without proper context (yes, even in the title), people will be wary of your questions. Even though you might be stressed out and need an answer ASAP, calming yourself and thinking through what you're actually trying to ask will benefit not only your mental clarity, but also help another help you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Calmly thinking through and asking a question under pressure is something I hope to improve as well. One time when I asked a friend for help with some debugging I was so frustrated and crunched for time that I didn't provide enough background information. I wouldn't have wanted to answer my own question! I sent him my code and asked for help, but now realize all of the pieces of information I should have given him. People will jump on answering your question if you're specific about the things you've already tried, and what you're trying to accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's go over some points to note and think about when asking a question, so answers pour in for you.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Imagine you're trying to answer your own question. When you put yourself in another's shoes, the lens is always clearer.
          </li>
          <li>
            I know you need help, but making that your title won't helping anyone. The title of your question should provide a simple overview of the overall issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everything, in context! It's super helpful if you say what language you're working in, what version, what OS, and describe what you've already tried. Due diligience wins solvers' hearts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you to let others know what you were expecting your code to do, and what it's actually doing. If something is failing, they probably want to know.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the code you're sharing is as short as possible and relatively seamless for another to execute and debug with you.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
