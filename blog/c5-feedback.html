      <h1>Emotions On Feedback & Pairing</h1>
      <h3>Post Challenge Tales</h3>
      <h4>03/07/2015</h4>

      <p>
        Before being forced to pair twice a week, I used to think it wasn't a highly effective way to learn because of the time you would spend trying to understand what the other perosn is thinking. In this time you could have gone through your own logic and started coding, but boy was I wrong. Pairing is an <strong>extremely</strong> useful and necessary method of learning. I have learned so much in my past pairing sessions that I try to pair on as many challenges as I can now. When you pair, you need to understand what the other person is thinking in order to incorporate their ideas into a solution you may have thought of. This empathetic take on coding not only helps you understand concepts better, but also helps you build listening skills.
      </p>

        I really enjoyed pairing with the people that I have. It's always a much more fun environment than working alone because you are able to bounce ideas back and forth and discuss potential solutions. While doing this, there is a bunch of knowledge transfer as well. There was one particular challenge where my pairing partner wanted to split ways, but I encouraged pushing through, and we did, but before reaching the end I also had a moment where I wanted to break away and talk later. At this point, he helped me push through. This type of coding collaboration was beneficial because we both supported each other to finish the challenge emotionally and ended up learning different ways to execute the same lines of code, such as with regex.
      </p>

        I feel pretty good after reading the feedback I received from the previous pairing sessions. The overall feeling made me realize I do explain concepts well to people that may be trying to learn it for the first time, and that I am easy to work with because of my sense of humor. There was also a comment that urged me to speak my mind more so that the my pairing partner knows what exactly is going through my head. This criticism was very helpful because it definitely makes sense that the other person should know what's going through my head. Now I consciously make the effort to throw out ideas and questions instead of pondering them through in my head first.
