      <h1>Value Your Efficiency</h1>
      <h3>Why Efficiency Leads to More Satisfaction</h3>
      <h4>03/23/2015</h4>

      <p>
        When I look back and think of times where I've been happiest, proud, and most satisfied, efficiency was always involved. Accomplishments give me happiness, but accomplishing goals within an expected time frame and with great execution gives me satisfaction. Completing the small goals that make up larger accomplishments with proper time management is bliss. Since time is the only true unit of measurement, making sure I plan and savor each minute is important to me. Your time management on a daily basis dictates how efficiently you will reach your goals, and this is why I believe efficiency is the key to satisfying success.

        A few days ago my friend asked me for advice on how to be more efficient in her daily life as she struggled with self-motivation. I suggested she time herself because it's easy to waste an entire day not realizing how many hours are passing by. I also asked her to list out where her energy was going on an average day. After going through her list, we noticed she needed to cut out time she spent on social media apps like Instagram and Facebook.

      <p>
        There are a couple other values I find valuable, which includes confidence, courage, decisiveness, ambition, compassion, enthusiasm, and spirituality. When I think about my values I feel at peace with myself. I simultaneously like who I am and who I am becoming. I'm definitely not exactly where I want to be, so there is a lot of room for improvement, but knowing I'm improving is satisfying for the time being. If I have to mediate stereotype threat, I would firstly be courageous enough to confront the person who may have initiated it to have a conversation, and then speak with confidence.

        If I'm down for any other reason, I would definitely turn to music! Music has the ability to evoke different types of emotions, including that of calmness and happiness.
