      <p>
        When I took the <a href "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregoric Thinking Style quiz</a>, I found out my mind worked <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Abstract Sequentially</a> (AS). In a different quiz I also found out I was a multimodal learner, which means I learn best by being exposed to different types of material. It's a combo deal. I am a Visual and Kinesthetic learner. This means I like to both visualize what I am working on, and getting straight into projects and learn by doing.

        Let's break down what Abstract Sequential actually means. The abstract aspect means you have the ability to visualize and conceive of ideas which aren't actually visible. People of this mindset are intuitive, imaginative, and can see beyond the explicit. Sequential refers to being able to mentally organize information linearly. People with this characteristic think logically.

        Up to this point, Phase 0 has been moving quite smoothly. The biggest struggle would be time management. I'm glad I'm learning so much about myself so that I can fix old habits to boost my productivity. The way I think isn't correlated to my time management and time boxing skills. It hasn't been 21 days yet, so I know my new habits will continue to solidify. Patience is another aspect of myself I have been focusing on improving via meditation. To learn more effectively, I am exposing myself to more resources than just the textbook or online tutorials. Having a combination of external resources allows me to gain and retain information in the best possible way.
