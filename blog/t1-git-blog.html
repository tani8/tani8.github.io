        Version control does just that, it gives you control of the different saved versions of your files. When you play a video game and reach a save point, it's a lifesaver since you know that even if you get killed right after, you won't have to start all the way from the beginning. This is what version control does too. Developers are able to start from any of their previously saved "checkpoints", or commits, which allows them to go back to a working version of a file.

        How are these changes tracked by git you ask? When you want to save the changes you made to a file in your project, you will move through stages from working, to staged, to commit. The working stage is when you're still editing a file and have not "added" the file to git. A file moves from working to staged when you add it to git via "git add [filename]". Then, you can move the file to the commit stage with a message via "git commit -m [message]". The last commit will send your changes to update your newest "checkpoint".
      </p>

        For ease of use, you'll need an account on a handy website called GitHub to store code. GitHub is not just a social medium for developers to interact and code with each other, but also a place to track your file versions and store code efficiently. If you are working on a project with a group, GitHub lets you easily have people join your repositories, or folders, so that everyone can work on the same files. Another benefit is that you can create something called a "pull request". This is where you would assign someone from your group to take a look at the code you think is ready before it is put into the working group project. This will prevent any inconsistencies as a second pair of eyes are able to take a look at the code.
