      <h1>Initial Take on DBC</h1>
      <h3>Based on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h3>
      <h4>02/08/2015</h4>
      <p>
        The DBC experience exudes a caring, action-oriented, ambitous, and challenging feeling. This experience isn't just about knowing how to code enough to get a job as a software engineer, it's also about becoming a more efficient learner, developing a creative mindset, taking responsibility for your future, and taking charge of your life. My impression of DBC is that they want to help bring out the best in you by giving you control and the resources you'll need to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This culture is going to be very beneficial since there will be a lot of driven people around me working to reach a common goal. While exposing ignorance and feeling vulnerable, it's important to have a safe and kind environment to learn optimally. I see myself interacting with all the other students and exchanging knowledge, while making lasting friendships. All of us will add to the value of the program one pinch at a time by acting as chefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expectations have somewhat changed after hearing what Shereef had to say in the Fireside chat. Anything we learn now will continue to change and the most important thing to understand is how to learn. This allows us to expand our horizon and see that we can learn any language that we want, which sets us up to become great engineers. Since most people in society have a consumer mindset, I thought DBC might teach in that style. It was exciting and refreshing to hear that as a student, I would be able to take control of my experience and make it as rewarding as I would like!
      </p>
      <p>
        This learning environment really excites me! It's important to interact and program with other developers, as we will during pairing sessions, and vocalize our thought process so that we can establish effective communication and become confident in our abilites to talk about our code, especially for when interviews come around. With so many ambitious people who are passionate about technology and like-minded, I am more excited than nervous to interact and bounce ideas of one another. The two fears Shereef said most people walk into the program with - imposter syndrome and feeling you might be dragged through the program - made me think about my own fears, but knowing that others are walking in with these fears makes me feel more comfortable. As we start this journey to become amazing Software Engineers together, let's go far fast.
