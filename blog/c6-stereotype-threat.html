      <h1>Stereotype Threat and Imposter Syndrome</h1>
      <h3>Ew, I Don't Want To Be a Nerd in a Basement...</h3>
      <h4>03/15/2015</h4>

      <p>
        If you've ever felt like you wanted to do something, but hesitated because you know others would look at you through the lens of a negative sterotype, you already know what stereotype threat is. This also includes being afraid to do something because you know you'd fall under a certain stereotype that made you feel uncomfortable. Acclaimed social psychologist, Dr. Claude Steele, concludes that this is one of the major barriers holding back the achievement of women and other underrepresented groups.

        As I progressed from High School to College, I realized stereotype threat was more prevalent amongst women around me, than the men I interacted with. In my University, a class of 50 students in my engineering classes comprised of about 4 women, 5 if we're feeling hopeful. More girls are interested in math and science at a young age than engineering classes reflect in universities. I kept thinking, "Where did all the women go? I swear there was a decent amount of diversity in all of my math and science classes before this." Stereotype threat and imposter syndrome hit the nail on the head.

      <p>
        I realized most of the women I spoke to, whether friends or colleagues, all felt like engineering was just "too difficult", "boring", or as a programmer they didn't want to be that "person developing all alone in their room all day". The majority thought engineering was just not their cup of tea. This can definitely be attributed to imposter syndrome as well, since these women were pursuing challenging degrees but didn't believe they could become engineers. In an earlier post on "Getting Women Into Tech", I reference some causes of this thinking. It was clear that their decisions and ideas of what an engineering degree meant, was the result of clouded judgement with an overcast of sterotype threat.

      <p>
        There were definitely times in my undergraduate career when I doubted myself and thought twice about whether I was doing what I wanted to do, and whether it was an attainable goal. The guys in my classes would always group up together, assuming the women would either be too much of a hassle to work with or wouldn't be able to contribute as effectively as their male friends. I went on and did indeed complete my Bachelors Degree as an engineer. Knowing that there were so few women in the Technology Industry pushed me to succeed and persevere even more. Attempting to patch the cracks and gaps in diversity in the workplace today, I try to encourage women in my personal life to pursue technical degrees or interests. They need to believe that they have the same ability as anyone else, and the life of an engineer is not as bland as stereotypes have them believe.
