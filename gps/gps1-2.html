        <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is when two people work together on a project or some type of coding exercise at one computer. During this collaboration, one person takes on the role of a Driver, and the other,
        a Navigator. In this process, both sides learn to acknowledge and truly listen to each other as they bounce
        ideas back and forth. The Navigator guides the Driver as she/he codes, and provides suggestions on different
        ways to find a solution.

        <h3>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>
          Pair Programming is important to DBC because it cultivates an essential habit of working with others and
          communicating effectively. This is hugely important in the workplace on a daily basis since developers
          continuously work with other developers. Knowing how to interact with others via patience, and understanding
          your own thought process will help you become a better collaborator.

        <h3>Comparing Driver and Navigator...</h3>
        <p>
          The Driver and Navigator work together by throwing out suggestions and ways to design and execute the code,
          but the Driver is in control of the keyboard while the Navigator gives information for what they should be
          seeing as output. The Driver is a little more hands-on (the keyboard), but the Navigator has just as important
          of a role as they over-see the output and suggest different potential solutions.

  Release 4: Reflect
    Pairing this time was a little different because my partner had internet connectivity issues, so the guide and I had to eventually decide to move on without him. My comfort level was about the same, I liked the exercise/project in this GPS better than the Git tutorial from last week. I think I have met all four of the learning competencies. The concept of pair programming is understood and HTML and CSS concepts have been solidified.
